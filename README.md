# Fine-Tuning_BERT

I am working on Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in BERT for my undergraduate's Final Year Project. This repo contains code for the vanilla fine-tuning on BERT on PAWS-X in Pytorch and Gluon.
Code that implements catastrophic forgetting fighting techniques for fine-tuning BERT will be published soon.
